## ROS ETETOS GARUNDOS -- la airport de tokyo

ROS ETETOS GARUNDOS, enlarged head syndrome. this was what the doctors diagnosed, when she had her cranium expanded, with biologically inert metallic plates holding her head together. every now and then she still gets head aches, and the powders that she receives as part of airline maid training only does so much for her.

initially SUZUKI MARIE did not have many chances to visit with the homeless looking girl, who would, despite being anglophone and being of the age where people still spoke english, spoke a natural degree of ROS EFURANSOS, and a passable amount of ROS EJAPANAISOS. she never had many opportunities to talk with her directly, despite being a frequent flier on airports in which she would travel. one of the first words they exchanged were:

-- so where are you off to?

-- to the next airport to find a great airport.

-- but surely you have some specific place to go?

-- i suppose, although part of the fun of travel is observe how different places operate their flights. it helps that there is a lot of beautiful women, who attend the flights.

the manners of the flight attendant prevented her being able to ask whether the homeless girl found her to be attractive. she was unsure however why this specifically mattered, except that there was something about the woman that did not seem like other government support homeless people that would take flights. her flights were to frequent, and therefore they would encounter each other to frequently. plus, getting through different nations security systems did not seem like a pleasurable experience. with almost every country in the west having an extreme amount of steps to go through just to be deemed safe enough to travel the globe.

RAH EBUMA INI ENERU, the bum in black. she would would be sleeping near the window, and sometimes not even requesting snacks, despite it not costing in an extra dime to tide one over.

-- are you hungry musa?

-- nio, gehi ne fam piesa.

-- how do you make sure you are fed.

-- me and friends i would meet would sometimes roast some coffee, and have korean and japanese barbecues outside. at other points i mostly just buy a salad and a beer.

MARIE had gotten used to receiving to much information from her charge. but sometimes this would distract her from her duties, in which the head would sometimes lecture her for malpractice. however, knowing that it was the only way in which she could receive pain medication, which was enough to keep her completely abandoning her job, as this was even more important than food sometimes, she eventually would break it off, and RAH EBUMA INI ENERU would would go back to sleep by the window, and read books about left-market anarchism, and various currently released manga she kept on her electronic reader.

the nature of the bum’s lifestyle preventing her from having a permanent home, because she wanted to maintain the illusion that she was rich enough to pay for various flights, but not enough to rent an extended stay hotel. thus she would buy whatever books she wanted on her electronic reader. eventually one of the airports in which she arrived had to take an extended flight delay. this gave the two time to exchange few more emotas.

-- i never got your name? marie asked.

-- i rarely use my real name anymore. however, online i refer to myself as “that precious reader”.

-- what would you read on your flights.

-- i would usually read manga currently released in japan. she offered marie a cigarette, but she waved it off. but i also sometimes beta reader fellow comic creators work.

-- i can’t smoke, it gives me head aches.

-- from that beautifully large head of yours.

-- pardon moi?

-- desole. didn’t mean to offend.

-- no, i’m just sensitive about.

the precious reader gently placed her palms on her head. suddenly all of the memories of marie would come into her head. marie would play different puzzles to expand her intelligence prowess, but at some point her brain started growing more rapidly than her skull could keep up. eventually the doctors became involved in an emergency procedure to expand its size. but there was a chance that it may shorten her life.

-- so in order to live, they took a chance on you.

-- how did you know?

-- lets just say, i have my way of things. but worry not. you’re one of the more beautiful girls that i have ever met.

-- is there somewhere you’d like to go next?

-- isn’t the flight delayed?

-- i mean here, at the “airport de tokyo”.

-- i have time if you to.

-- all the time in the world.
